# chip8-emu
 A basic emulator for Chip-8.

This is not 100% percent functional, but it's relatively easy to modify to add all the enhancements needed.



## Usage

![Main window of chip9-emu](capture.png)

Drag and drop any Chip-8 ROM files on the main window, and use the next keys to emulate the Chip-8 keyboard:

`` 1 2 3 4				 1 2 3 C ``
`` Q W E R	 	-->		 4 5 6 D ``
`` A S D F	 	-->		 7 8 9 E ``
`` Z X C V				 A 0 B F ``



##  Known bugs / "To Do" list

- It has no sound, but the sound timer is totally working
- The screen flickers. Probably there are better ways to print the pixel screen
- Super Chip instructions are not implemented
- Waiting for keyboard event isn't implemented
